# odin-recipes
my first project:) im so excited
Start of project [16/09/2022 23:57] - my current project is to create a website for recipes, using HTML. Very, very basic stuff but doing anything at this stage is pretty damn cool, especially a project from scratch. By the end of this project, I'll have tied together most of my knowledge when it comes to using git and its basic commands, my rudimentary knowledge of HTML, and the general process of going from nothing to being able to show off my first project.

End of project [] -
