        <p>Someone's grandmother's recipe for roasted chicken.</p>
        <img src="./../images-and-gifs/juicy-roasted-chicken-image.jpeg" alt="Juicy roasted chicken!">
        <h3 class="heading"><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
        <p><ul>
            <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup margarine, divided</li>
            <li>1 stalk celery, leaves removed</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h3 class="heading"><u>Instructions</u></h3>
        <h5>Step 1:</h5>
        <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
        <h5>Step 2:</h5>
        <p>Place chicken in a roasting pan, and season generously inside and out with salt and pepper.
            Sprinkle inside and out with onion powder. Place 3 tablespoons margarine in the chicken cavity.
            Arrange dollops of the remaining margarine around the chicken's exterior. Cut the celery into 3
             or 4 pieces, and place in the chicken cavity.</p>
        <h5>Step 3:</h5>
        <p>Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run
            clear, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part
            of the thigh, near the bone, should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove from heat and
            baste with melted margarine and drippings. Cover with aluminum foil and allow to rest about 30
            minutes before serving.</p>
